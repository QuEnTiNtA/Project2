# Dynamic Augmentations 

## Functions of files
`model.py`: For the U-Net architecture. One can modify activation function in line 11, 12, 15, 16, and list of features in line 24 to get desired setting.  

`train.py`: Functions for training the model and image predictions.

`run.py`: Create the checkpoint for the running model.

`post_processing.py`: Patching a small set of predicted images to generate the final predictions.

`mask_to_submission.py`: Create the submission file.

`utils.py`: Functions for running and post_processing.

`find_hard_examples.ipynb`: Identify 20 rather complicated images hard to make predictions.

`morphological operations.ipynb`: Experiment morphological transformation such as Open and Close.

## Get the best result

### Generate the best checkpoint 
In `run.py`:  
* change the checkpoint_name to your choice 

Run `run.py` with :  
`dynamic_augmentation/run.py`  

The total running time is around 10 hours.

### Generate the best predicted test images 
In `post_processing.py`:  
* load your saved checkpoint in line 10 

Run `post_processing.py` with :  
`dynamic_augmentation/post_processing.py`  

### Generate the best submission file
Run `mask_to_submission.py` with :  
`dynamic_augmentation/mask_to_submission.py` 

## Usage

As we accidentally lost the best checkpoint, which was able to reach the F1 score of 91.4% in the AICROWD platform () here we could only provide the second best saved checkpoint (F1 score: 91.3%). It can be accessed in the google drive:
`https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n4wEti1m8xPaQ642XjxU_IkAoviADDys?usp=sharing`  
One can download the checkpoints to the main and load in `post_processing.py`, then run `mask_to_submission.py` to get the final submission.
